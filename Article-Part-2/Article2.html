      <p>You've been making games since you were 13. Was it just sort of a
        <br>
        natural progression for you, going from loving games to making them?
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        It did feel like a pretty natural progression. I've always had an
        <br />interest in games. The first console I ever had was a Sega Genesis
        <br />and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was the firt game I played that had such a
        <br />huge influence on me. To this day that game inspires the colors that
        <br />I use and the vibe and enthusiasm I try to put into my work. That
        <br />game was just really formative for me and I loved it so much.
        <br />After playing the game for a while we discovered the debug mode
        <br />cheat, which allowed you to go around the map and place things in
        <br />the game. It was pretty much just a testing tool for the developers,
        <br />but that really inspired me. It revealed to me an extra layer that
        <br />goes on beneath the surface of the game that the average player
        <br />doesn't even know about. I think that's what subconsciously inspired
        <br />me to pursue this, even before I knew what went into games or that
        <br />it was something that I could do. Because of that I was telling
        <br />people, "Oh yeah, I want to be a game designer when I grow up"... but
        <br />never did I think I would actually accomplish that. </div>

<strong>
Do you remember the first thing that you made where you're like,
<br />"Oh, this is actually a real thing. This is more than just a hobby
<br />or something I do for fun. This feels real."
</strong>
<br>
<br>
The second I got my first scipt working, and even more so the
<br />second I made something move on the screen-that was such a huge
<br />moment for me. To this day it still doesn't get old. The first time
<br />you see something on the screen move because of code you've written
<br />is just like, "Wow." You feel like it's way more in your grasp than
<br />you'd ever thought possible. I remember jumping up and almost being
<br />teary I was so happy. I was just like, "Yo, I bt I can make a full
<br />game."
<br>

Looking at your website, it seems like your entire identity as a
  <br />creator/designer is already to fully realized. Your games are all
  <br />visible, you link out to your collaborators, and you have merch for
  <br />sale. How did you develop you identity? Was it something you had
  <br />in mind from the beginning?

<br>

  Yeah. I've always had this visual aesthetic. I always loved
    <br />designin logos for things. I  love picking out color schemes. I
    <br />loved graphic design even before I knew what "graphic design" was.
    <br />Even back in the days when all I had was MS Paint I would sometimes
    <br />draw out website layouts and stuff just because it was fun. Later on
    <br />when it was time to actually create an identitfy for Terrifying
    <br />Jellyfish I was like, "Okay, I'll just make it as neat as possible
    <br />and I'll make it as colorful as I see it in my head. I'm just gonna
    <br />make it super me." That's how it started. When I started the company
    <br />in 2014, I was 18. I already knew what kind of stuff I liked and
    <br />what I wanted it to be and what direction I wanted the brand to go
    <br />in simply because I knew I wanted something that appealed perfectly
    <br />to my own interests. I only worried about pleasing myself. It
    <br />evolved from there.

  <strong>
What drew you specifically towards creating games as opposed to
  <br />being a graphic designer or a a video artist? What is it about games
  <br />that appeals to you?
  </strong>
  <br>
  <br>

Well, I love expressing myself in a different mediums. I also do video
  <br />work every now and then or I'll do something 2D just to try
  <br />something different. there's a lot of platforms that I want to
  <br />express myself in. I can never have enough creative outlets, but I
  <br />always come back to games because they feel so exciting to me. I
  <br />think that's in part because of what a relatively new genre it is.
  <br />With video games, I feel like there's so many permutations of what
  <br />you can do with that platform and still so little that's been
  <br />explored. So many games are just derivative of each other, so
  <br />there's still space to create something completely new and that
  <br />hasn't been seen before. A lot of indie games are going in that
  <br />direction. It's uncharted territory.
  <br>
  <br>

<strong>
You'll soon be releasing NOUR, a game you funded on Kickstarter.
  <br>What was the impetus to make a game all about food?
  </strong>
  <br>
  <br>

It literally started with a bowl of ramen and a cup of bubble tea. I
    <br />knew that there was already a culture around those kind of food
    <br />items because when I'd scroll through Tumblr or twitter I'd see
    <br />endless pictures of ramen or bubble tea, these really beautiful,
    <br />stylized photos. I'd see lots of food pics on all of these artsy
    <br />looking blogs with these amaxing colors and well-composed pictures
    <br />of food. I was interested in that. I was like, "Okay, there really
    <br />is a whole aesthetic surrounding food, especially ones using soft
    <br />colors that kind of match and convey the flavor through the way they
    <br />look." I became interested in that concept so I first made the
    <br />bubble tea just as a test to see if that was something I could do in
    <br />3D. It was literally just an art test to see if I could create a shader that stimulates bubble tea.
</div>

<p align="center">
<img src="bubbletea.gif" alt="bubble tea" width="730" height="300">
</p>

<div class="center">
  So I did that and uploaded it to Twitter and the response was great.<br />People were like, "oh my gosh, as soon as I saw that the flavor<br /> appeared into my mouth." I thought that was interesting, so I did<br />the same with my ramen scene and once again the response was the<br />same. The original tweet I made about it blew up. It was a little<br />video I recorded of noodles falling into a bowl and then meat<br />following it. People's responses inspired me to  make more of it.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  After I showed those off, a friend of mine was throwing an event and
    <br />wanted me to show something at it. He was wondering if I could show
    <br />my food art in some way. And I was like, "Well, I make games so what
    <br />better way to do this than to try to make a game out of it." Since
    <br />it was an art show and not really a games show, I just made it to
    <br />where you could press buttons to interect with the food-like buttons
    <br />that popped the popcorn or whatever. That was the first interaction of
    <br />the game, before I even knew it was gona be a game. It was just
    <br />playing with your food. People loved it. I found it interesting that
    <br />it was a game that could fit within this art space. It was engaging
    <br />enough while also not having any scores or objectives or the rules
    <br />of any other traditional game.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>
    It's described online as a game with no goals or objectives. What is
    <br />it about that particularly that appeals to you?
    </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
  To me it's something that makes the game a lot more accessible.
      <br />Sometimes when I'm at game events I see people appoach a game, but
      <br />they won't really play it themselves because they're afraid that
      <br />they're going to do it wrong, or they're gonna lose, or they're
      <br />gonna mess something up. They feel the need to perform, so they'll
      <br />just watch someone else play because they're too scared to play it
      <br />themselves. I've found that with a game with no goals or objective
      <br />people will see that the experience is open. You get out of it
      <br />exactly what you put into it. There's no wrong way to do it.
  <br>
  <br>

  I've seen it at many game events. Someone will come up skittishly,
    <br />press the button, and just see what happens. When they see that that
    <br />something fun and rewarding happens, then they press another button.
    <br />By the end of it, they're smiling and mashing buttons and it's an
    <br />amazing experience. At the same time, anyone can enjoy it. You don't
    <br />have to be a gamer at all. You can just eperience it as an art
    <br />piece. Anyone can just walk up to it and interact with it.
  <br>
  <br>

  <div class="center">
Competitive games reach into our inner instincts to compete and be
    <br />the best and do something grandiose. Those kinds of games increase
    <br />tension. They increasingly raise the stakes, which can be stressful.
    <br />That's why some people like them. With something like NOUR, a game
    <br />with no real objective or way to do it wrong, it's a completely
    <br />different experience because you are simply pleasing yourself by
    <br />making something satisfying happen on the screen. It's about
    <br />satisfaction-here's your expectation and here's the immediate
    <br />feedback from your input. It's something completely different from
    <br />what people expect games to be.
  <br>
  <br>
    When you're doing the kind of work that involves coding and hours
      <br />spent staring at a computer screen, how do you keep from burning out
      <br />and going crazy?

  <br>
  <br>
  This is a problem I've run into recently. Something that I didn't
    <br />realize about working for yourself was just that a lot of times
    <br />you'll end up inside the house and you won't leave for days on end.
    <br />You'll just notice, "Oh, hey, I just haven't seen another human in a
    <br />day or two." I used to work in an office, so it's only recently that
    <br />I became self-employed. Before, there was a place to go to every
    <br />day. There was an environment that was changing and brand new every
    <br />day. There were people.

<div class="center">
When you're working from home you don't really get that. You go stir
  <br />crazy. You get cabin fever. If you work alone with a computer,
  <br />something really important for your mental health and your
  <br />productivity is to figure out how are you going to have ineraction
  <br />with other people. How are you going to satisfy your other human
  <br />needs other than working? There's a lot of ways to manage that,
  <br />whether it be taking walk breaks or hitting up your friends. I think
  <br />it's important just to reach out to other people who are also
  <br />working freelance and be like, "Hey, want to work in the same
  <br />space?" Just to have that kind of flow. It makes you a lot more
  <br />cognizant of what you need to make yourself mentally happy. I would
  <br />say that if you don't ignore those signs then that's a good way to
  <br />prevent burn out. Your work will also improve if you remember to
  <br />take breaks, clear your head, and not get lost in it.
<br>
<br>
How do you get feedback? Do you have a trusted network of people to
<br />share things with?
<br>
<br>
If it's something that would really require a designer's eye to test
<br />out, I do have a select channel of other developers from all over
<br />that I can talk to. It's definitely a good idea to create a network
<br />of other people that are doing what you're doing so that you can
<br />test out ideas, ask them what they think of things, etc. You often
<br />need honest, open criticism of what you're doing. I ask friends if I
<br />want an actual opinion from a player on what to do about things.
<br />Sometimes, especially if it's just a little art thing that's
<br />unfinished or whatever, I'll put it out to Tumblr or Twitter jus to
<br />be like, "Hey, look at this neat little thing that I did. It's not
<br />finished, what do you think?" It's important to show what you're
<br />working on to different kinds of audiences.

<div class="center">Knowing now how much time and energy it takes to bring a game to
  <br />fruition-including development and raising the money, etc-how do you
  <br />decide which projects to pursue? Do you just go where the energy
  <br />seems to be?
<br>
<br>
It can be difficult to figure that out because what you're excited
<br />about might not be what everyone else is excited about. I think a
<br />really important part of figuring out what project to tackle next is
<br />just not getting feedback. It shows you that people around you are
<br />indeed interested in this and if you were to pursue it that it would
<br />be a really good endeavor, which is something that will motivate you
<br />more to work on it. Often with games you'll find that your drive to
<br />make something won't last as long as it will take to actually make
<br />it. By the time you're six months into development you're like, "All
<br />right. I'm over this idea. I want to work on something else."
<br>
<br>
If you get that active feedback from other players, other developers
<br />early on, and if you see that they really like what you're doing and
<br />they really like the idea, then that will motivate you to the finish
<br />line. Just show people, get a guage of interest, but also listen to
<br />yourself and listen to see if your heart is saying that this is a
<br />project you truly want to work on.

You really have to feel it. For example, NOUR was a project I never
<br />intended to be a full game, but it was the response of people on
<br>Twitter and on Tumblr that drove me to make it. Thinking about it
<br>now, it almost felt like it was a gift, "Oh, people want more of
<br>this and I'm the only person who can give it to them? Here you go."
<br>It's a super good feeling when people like something that you love
<br>to work on and they want more of it."
